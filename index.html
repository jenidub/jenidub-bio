                <p>My name is Jeni Williams aka Jeni Dub and I would like to share my views
                    on why education is so broken. I have been working in public school education
                    and after school education for a combined 20+ years. No matter what school
                    district I end up in, I see the same problems - all talk, little action.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>What needs to be done to fix education is to make it finally people centered.
                    The stated purpose of education is: to prepare each students for 
                    their unique future so that they are independent productive citizens in society.
                    Even though that is the stated purpose, our educational system is not designed and
                    teachers are not trained to make that a reality.

                <p>4Ward is the solution our communities need every student who enters our program will make genuine
                    connections with adults and professional mentors who will not only tell them how to get there but 
                    also show them how to be the future they want to see (thank you President Obama). Want to move 4Ward
